										<h3>Chem-E-Car</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We represent UBC in the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Chem-E-Car competition. We design, build and test a shoe-box sized car from scratch every year. The process involves building a power system, selecting a stopping mechanism reaction, designing the circuitry, coding microcontrollers and assembling the mechanical components and car body.</p>

									<p>Do you enjoy beer? Fermentation started in the Bronze Age and is theorized to be the main driver behind the origin of civilization! We are building an automated brewing system on campus that can be accurately controlled to produce a desired beer style!</p>

										<h3>Flow Cell</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Renewable energy sources like wind and solar provide power output that depends largely on environmental conditions. Efficient, affordable energy storage systems are essential for the viability of renewable energy. To address this issue, we invite students to engage in an ambitious, multi-disciplinary project in the design and construction of a sustainable microgrid system on campus using rechargeable redox flow batteries.</p>

										<h3>Algae Project</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The algae project is a foray into understanding the world's energy needs and the requirements needed to sustain it. This has led to an initiative to learn about microalgae biochemicals and biofuels, focusing on rethinking photobioreactor design to optimize cell growth and fuel yield.</p>
